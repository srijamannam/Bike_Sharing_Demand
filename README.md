# Bike_Sharing_Demand

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis on rent. A US-based rental bike provider wants to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue.

Solution:
1) exploratory data analysis 
2) data cleaning.
3) feature selection with the help of RFE and Variance Inflation Factor and p-value.
4) used LinearRegression from SKLearn and OLS from statsmodels for building the model.
5) validated the linear regression assumptions
