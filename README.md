# Bike_Sharing_Demand

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis on rent. A US-based rental bike provider wants to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue.

The company wants to find out the key driving factors for the demand for shared bikes. These will help them to construct the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customerâ€™s expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

Solution:
1) exploratory data analysis 
2) data cleaning.
3) feature selection with the help of RFE and Variance Inflation Factor and p-value.
4) used LinearRegression from SKLearn and OLS from statsmodels for building the model.
5) validated the linear regression assumptions
